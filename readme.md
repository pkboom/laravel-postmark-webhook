You can also use options such as `--bounce` and `--spam`.

You can optionally publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pkboom\PostmarkWebhook\PostmarkWebhookServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

return [
    /**
     * You can set up postmark user and password here. They should be the same values as you set up
     * in postmark webhook page.
     */
    'user' => env('POSTMARK_USER', null),
    'password' => env('POSTMARK_PASSWORD', null),
];
```

If you want to use `Basic auth credentials`, go to `postmark webhook` page and set up credentials.
